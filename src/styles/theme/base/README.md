# Base

The `_base/` folder holds global styles and boilerplate code for the project.

## What are base styles?

Base styles are typically the styles you want to apply globally. In this architecture, the `_base/` include styles to target plain HTML elements, define basic typographic rules, override the Bootstrap grid system, and reset certain DNN-specific classes that would otherwise conflict with both Bootstrap and our custom styles.
