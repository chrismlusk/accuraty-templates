# Layout

The `_layout/` folder contains everything needed when laying out templates. This folder will have stylesheets for the main parts of the site. What makes something suited for `layout/` vs. `components/`? A good rule of thumb is if there is a native HTML5 tag, then it is a layout element (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`).

Layout styles are meant for the macro-level items that are _generally_ global â€” but they don't have to be.

For example, the footer might appear on every page but only certain pages have a sidebar. That means the sidebar is not a global element, but since it's still a large block that forms the shape of a layout, we define its styles as layout styles.
