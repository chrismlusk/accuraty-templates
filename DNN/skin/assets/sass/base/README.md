# Base

The `base/` folder holds global styles and boilerplate code for the project. In here, you will find resets, typographic rules, and a stylesheet (usually called `_base.scss`) to define standard styles for common HTML elements.

*Note: When using resets, remember there is no need to include Normalize.css because Bootstrap incorporates this into its own reset. Generally, this stylesheet is helpful for resetting styles defined by the content management system.*
