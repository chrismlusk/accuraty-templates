# Razor Scripts

This folder contains scripts used by the Razor module.

## Provided scripts

### Theme Components

### Theme Typography

To see how basic typography looks with theme and `_content.scss` styles.

## File names

The naming convention for Razor scripts is underscore, client abbreviation, underscore, name, and the file extension `cshtml`. The files included in this starter template are basic scripts commonly used in our projects. To customize or add project-specific ones, please prefix those files with another underscore and the client abbreviation.

For development-specific files or scripts otherwise not intended for production, begin the file name with two underscores and "ASL" to make the purpose clear.

### Examples

- Common file: `_SidebarMenu.cshtml`
- Client-specific: `_ABC_ExamplePageList.cshtml`
- Development file: `__ASL_ThemeComponents.cshtml`

## What is Razor?

Razor is a syntax based on ASP.NET that lets you easily embed C# or VB code inside an HTML page. It's not a programming language but a server-side markup language. Learn more [here](https://www.w3schools.com/asp/razor_intro.asp).
